## Introduction
For this first tutorial dedicated to the development of the Helios Launcher, we will modify the welcome page, change the logo, the name of the folder where the data are stored and the name of the launcher. We will also create the Helios Launcher fork and install the software required to properly develop the Helios Launcher.
## Video
This tutorial is based on the video you can watch below (**in French**):

## Licence
There was a time when the launcher was under custom license, now it is available under <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_MIT" target="_blank">Licence MIT</a>

## Getting started: Creating a project fork
Start by creating a <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_BLANK">GitHub account</a>, then go to the <a href="https://github.com/dscalzi/helioslauncher">project page</a>.  
<img src="/img/helios-p1/Fork.jpg" width="70%"/>

You then click on the `Fork` button.
<img src="/img/helios-p1/Fork-2.jpg" width="70%"/>

Wait a few moments for GitHub to clone the Helios Launcher repo to your account.
This step should not take more than 1 minute.
So we can move on.

## Change the launcher name on GitHub

We are going to change the name of the GitHub fork, because we don't necessarily all want it to be called HeliosLauncher
To avoid this, go to your repository settings:

You can change the name of your launcher by clicking on Rename
<img src="/img/helios-p1/rename.jpg" width="70%"/>

## Install these programs in order to modify the source code

We will have to use 3 programs:
### Node.JS
This software is used to execute the launcher code. It is to the launcher what the engine is to the car.
To download it, go to <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_BLANK">the official website</a> and download the latest LTS version for your computer.
### GitHub Desktop
It will be used to "push" the modifications on GitHub. Go to <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_BLANK">here</a> to download it. You'll then need to log into GitHub.
:::note
If you prefer, you can use another Git client, like <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git</a>, <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>, or <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Sourcetree</a>.
:::
### Visual Studio Code
It is used to modify the source code of our launcher. You can download it for free from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_BLANK">Microsoft's website</a>.
:::note
If you prefer to use another code editor like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>, feel free.
:::

## Download the fork
We have created our fork, but we need to download it locally, so we will use GitHub Desktop.
Start the repository, then log in if you haven't already. Then press the `Clone a repository from the internet` button and select your fork.
Change the download location if necessary. Then press the `Clone` button

A popup will ask you how you want to use your fork. Answer with "For my own purposes", then validate.

## Modify the fork

### Edit launcher metadata
Click on `Open with Visual Studio Code`, then on the left, open the package.json file. Modify it to suit your needs. Below is an example:
```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers {2,3,4,5,6,8,10,52}
{
  "name": "mylauncher",
  "version": "1.9.0",
  "productName": "My Launcher",
  "description": "Launcher to access My Server",
  "author": "Daniel Scalzi (https://github.com/dscalzi/) + yourname",
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/pseudogithub/mylauncher",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/pseudogithub/mylauncher/issues"
  },
  "private": true,
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron .",
    "dist": "electron-builder build",
    "dist:win": "npm run dist -- -w",
    "dist:mac": "npm run dist -- -m",
    "dist:linux": "npm run dist -- -l",
    "lint": "eslint --config .eslintrc.json ."
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "16.x.x"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@electron/remote": "^2.0.8",
    "adm-zip": "^0.5.9",
    "async": "^3.2.4",
    "discord-rpc-patch": "^4.0.1",
    "ejs": "^3.1.8",
    "ejs-electron": "^2.1.1",
    "electron-updater": "^5.3.0",
    "fs-extra": "^10.1.0",
    "github-syntax-dark": "^0.5.0",
    "got": "^11.8.5",
    "helios-core": "~0.1.2",
    "jquery": "^3.6.1",
    "node-disk-info": "^1.3.0",
    "node-stream-zip": "^1.15.0",
    "request": "^2.88.2",
    "semver": "^7.3.8",
    "tar-fs": "^2.1.1",
    "winreg": "^1.2.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^21.3.1",
    "electron-builder": "^23.6.0",
    "eslint": "^8.28.0"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/pseudogithub/mylauncher.git"
  }
}
```
Once the change is made, run `npm i` in a Terminal (Terminal --> New Terminal)

:::note
Each time you modify the `package.json` file, you will have to run the `npm i` command again.
:::

### Change the name of the launcher

Open `app/frame.ejs` and around line 16, change "Helios Launcher" to the name of your launcher.
```diff {3,4} title="app/frame.ejs"
            <div id="frameContentWin">
                <div id="frameTitleDock">
-                <span id="frameTitleText">Helios Launcher</span>
+                <span id="frameTitleText">My Launcher</span>
                </div>
                <div id="frameButtonDockWin">`
```
Then under `app/app.ejs`, change the text in the `<title>` tag:
```diff title="app/app.ejs" {3,4}
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'sha256-In6B8teKZQll5heMl9bS7CESTbGvuAt3VVV86BUQBDk='"/>
-    <title>Helios Launcher</title>
+    <title>My Launcher</title>
    <script src="./assets/js/scripts/uicore.js"></script>
    <script src="./assets/js/scripts/uibinder.js"></script>
```
### Change logos
On GitHub Desktop, click on `Repository --> Show in explorer`
Open the folder `app/assets/images/`. SealCircle.png is the logo in the background of the loading page. 
Finally, go back to the root of your launcher, under `build`, replace the `icon.png` logo by your logo.


### Change the welcome text
Under `app/welcome.ejs`, change the welcome text:
```diff title="app/welcome.ejs {3-6,8,9,12,13}"
    <div id="welcomeContent">
        <img id="welcomeImageSeal" src="assets/images/SealCircle.png"/>
-        <span id="welcomeHeader">WELCOME TO WESTEROSCRAFT</span>
+        <span id="welcomeHeader">WELCOME TO MY SERVER</span>
-        <span id="welcomeDescription">Our mission is to recreate the universe imagined by author George RR Martin in his fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire.  Through the collaborative effort of thousands of community members, we have sought to create Westeros as accurately and precisely as possible within Minecraft.  The world we are creating is yours to explore.  Journey from Dorne to Castle Black, and if you arenâ€™t afraid, beyond the Wall itself, but best not delay.  As the words of House Stark ominously warn: Winter is Coming.</span>
+        <span id="welcomeDescription">We wish you a good time on the server</span>
        <br>
-        <span id="welcomeDescCTA">You are just a few clicks away from Westeros.</span>
+        <span id="welcomeDescCTA">Get ready for an unforgettable adventure.</span>
        <button id="welcomeButton">
            <div id="welcomeButtonContent">
                CONTINUE
                <svg id="welcomeSVG" viewBox="0 0 24.87 13.97">
                    <defs>
```

### Change the launcher data folder
By default, Helios launcher will store its data in the ".helioslauncher" folder located at the following location:
<Tabs defaultValue="windows" groupId="operating-systems"
values={[
{label: "Windows", value:"windows"},
{label: "macOS", value:"macos"},
{label: "Linux", value:"linux"}
]}>
<TabItem value="windows"><code>%APPDATA%\.helioslauncher\</code></TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos"><code>~/Library/Application Support/.helioslauncher/</code></TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux"><code>~/.helioslauncher/</code></TabItem>
</Tabs>
To change this, just change one line in `app/assets/js/configmanager.js`

```diff title="app/assets/js/configmanager.js" {3,4}
const sysRoot = process.env.APPDATA || (process.platform == 'darwin' ? process.env.HOME + '/Library/Application Support' : process.env.HOME)
// TODO change
- const dataPath = path.join(sysRoot, '.helioslauncher')
+ const dataPath = path.join(sysRoot, '.mylauncher')

// Forked processes do not have access to electron, so we have this workaround.
```
If you have already launched your launcher, you will have to delete the folder with the name of your launcher, as below
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems" values={[
{label: "Windows", value:"windows"},
{label: "macOS", value:"macos"},
{label: "Linux", value:"linux"}
]}>
  <TabItem value="windows"><code>%APPDATA%\My Launcher\</code></TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos"><code>~/Library/Application Support/My Launcher/</code></TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux"><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Helios Launcher/</code> or <code>~/.config/Helios Launcher/</code></TabItem>
</Tabs>
