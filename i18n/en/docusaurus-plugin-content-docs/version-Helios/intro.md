# Welcome

This documentation is intended to explain in detail the customization of the Helios Launcher.
:::info
<u>Requirements:</u>  

* Basic knowledge of Node.JS
* A web server (if you can install a CMS like Azuriom, it would be perfect)
* A GitHub account
:::

:::danger
On the Helios Launcher Discord, I, GeekCorner, have seen several people wanting to use Dropbox, MediaFire, or GitHub to host their files. Avoid doing this, because:
* These sites are not designed to host files the way Helios Launcher needs it to be (so they are not comparable to a web server)
* You could easily receive DMCA requests
:::

:::caution
As has been explained several times on GitHub, the "Login offline" or "Crack" feature is not supported by Helios Launcher. If you are using a version that supports cracks, no support will be provided.
